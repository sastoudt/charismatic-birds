`raw_data/`

This directory stores the raw inputs for the analyses. To reproduce all analyses, you need to provide four files here, as described in the main repo README.

It also comes with two helper files: 

- `statecodes.csv` contains a list of two-letter US state codes and their corresponding names.
- `species_codes_tbl.csv` is a file containing a list of eBird species, their scientific names, and their corresponding [Open Tree of Life Taxonomy](https://tree.opentreeoflife.org/about/taxonomy-version/ott3.1) codes. The presence of this file speeds up some data processing steps.
