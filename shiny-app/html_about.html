<h1>Exploring charismatic birds</h1>

<p>This application lets you explore the results generated in the paper "Identifying charismatic bird species and traits with community science observations" by Stoudt, Goldstein, and de Valpine (2021).</p>

<h3>Estimating overreporting in community science</h3>
For each of 450+ species inhabiting the continental U.S., we estimated an overreporting index. The overreporting index represents how much birders are engaging with that species more or less than you'd expect if they didn't care about species.

<p>To estimate the overreporting indices, we harnessed observations from two community science databases, eBird and iNaturalist. eBird is a platform built around birding checklists; its users tend to report every bird they see (and indicate that they've done so). This makes eBird useful for getting a background picture at what an "unbiased" birder would see at a given location. iNaturalist, on the other hand, is built around making observations of individual animals; a birder using iNaturalist will usually choose which of the birds they see they'll report. This gives us a picture of what the birder thought was interesting or noteworthy.</p>

<p>For each species, we estimated a map of where in space it was being reported, and at what rates. Then we took the difference between these two maps. Across space, we found the median difference and called this typical result the "overreporting index." If birders weren't discerning between birds, we'd expect the rates to be the same in eBird as in iNaturalist. For an in-depth discussion of our methodology and how we estimated uncertainty, please refer to the manuscript linked above.</p>

<p>Instead, we found that nearly half (211 of 474) were either more or less reported than their baseline, which showed that people really did enngage more with certain birds over others when they had a choice.</p>

<h3>Using this app</h3>

<p>You can use this app to explore the overreporting indices we estimated along 
a number of dimensions. The "Trait Plots" tab lets you explore how the index 
varies with species traits (color and mass) and distributional characteristics 
(range size and prevalence). The "Browse species" tab shows side-by-side estimates of overreporting for all species or select species. The "Summaries" tab visualizes 
counts of over- and underreporting across all species or individual taxonomic 
orders.</p>
